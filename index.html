                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>

                <header>CSS first steps</header>
                <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.</p>

                <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.</p>

                <p>To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the <head> of the HTML document:</p>

                <code> link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"
                </code>

                <p>The link element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute.</p>

                <header>CSS building blocks</header>
                <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now that you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.</p>

                <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.</p>

                <code>
                    h1 {
                        color: blue;
                    }
                    
                    .special {
                        color: blue;
                    } 
                </code>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="styling_text">
                <header>Styling text</header>
                <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.</p>

                <code>
                    p {
                        color: red;
                    }
                </code>
            </section>
            
            <section class="main-section" id="css_layout">
                <header>CSS layout</header>
                <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.</p>
